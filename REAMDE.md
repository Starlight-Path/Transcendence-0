# Transendence 0 - Volumes Archieve

## Info
This is a collection of latex files for the plot Transendence 0.

We currently have chapters 1-5 of Volume 1 published. 

We recommend to install the zip files directly through the releases, but if you wish, you may clone this repository and use a LaTeX compiler such as MikTex or TexLive. Note for TexLive, you may need to install the extra packages as these use the forloop package.

## Summary
The 2050s, a NEO era of industrialization and modern technological growths that allowed for significantly improved life quality. However, the constant of time has yet to be manipulated. Luke, having lost everything, wishes that there was a way to move time around. Navigating his life, he meets up with a decision; let a group, the same one that caused the fatal incident, reverse the world to Year 0, or stop them with his old group, leaving them to embrace the past. 

In a world where time can never reverse, the stakes are high. The futures of Lukeâ€¦ and the others are in his hands. Will he end up resurrecting the past into the future, or diminishing the future into the past?

## Notes
The current image of Volume 1 is misnamed, due to a change in name while in progress. This will be adjusted later.
